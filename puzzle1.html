                <h2>Gemba Walk: Spot the Processes!</h2>
                <p>Alright, Chef <span id="puzzlePlayerName"></span>! You and Heidi are now in the heart of Dangugu's kitchen chaos. Your mission is to observe these 8 scenes and correctly identify which of the core kitchen processes each photo represents. This is the essence of a Gemba Walk - seeing the work as it truly happens!</p>
                <p>Select the correct process for each photo from the dropdown list. You need to identify at least 6 out of 8 correctly to help Heidi map out the current state.</p>
                <p><strong>The 8 Core Kitchen Processes:</strong></p>
                <ol>

                    <h3>Great Job! Understanding the Gemba Walk</h3>
                    <p>You've successfully identified the current processes! The Gemba Walk is a cornerstone of Lean thinking. 'Gemba' (現場) is a Japanese term that means "the actual place" or "the real place." In a business context, it's where value is created – in our case, the kitchen.</p>
                    <p><strong>Key aspects of a Gemba Walk:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Go See:</strong> Don't rely on reports or assumptions. Witness the process firsthand.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ask Why:</strong> Understand the purpose of each step and challenge existing methods.</li>
                        <li><strong>Show Respect:</strong> Engage with the people doing the work; they are the experts.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>By observing these 8 processes, you've taken the first critical step in identifying inefficiencies and opportunities for improvement at Dangugu Restaurant.</p>
                    <h4>Application in Singapore Public Service:</h4>
                    <p>For Singapore's public officers, a Gemba Walk could mean visiting a service center to observe citizen interactions, shadowing a colleague to understand a complex internal workflow, or observing how a new policy is being implemented on the ground. This direct observation helps uncover pain points, resource misallocations, and areas where processes can be streamlined to deliver better value to citizens and stakeholders. It fosters a culture of continuous improvement (Kaizen) essential for public sector excellence.</p>
