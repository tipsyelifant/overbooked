                    <p>Welcome, <span id="storyPlayerName">Chef</span>! You've stepped into Dangugu Steamboat Restaurant. It used to be the talk of the town for its amazing steamboat and lively atmosphere. But look around... things aren't what they used to be. The air is thick with tension, not just steam!</p>
                    
                    <h3>Meet the Crew:</h3>
                    <div class="character-intro">
                        <img src="images/characters/heidi.png" alt="Heidi, a young chef with glasses and a determined look." class="character-profile">
                        <p><strong>Heidi:</strong> Our newest chef. She's energetic, armed with fresh ideas from her culinary school, and a bit shocked by the... *current operational tempo*. "There has to be a better way!" she often mutters.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="character-intro">
                        <img src="images/characters/leon.png" alt="Leon, an older, experienced chef with a skeptical expression." class="character-profile">
                        <p><strong>Leon:</strong> The kitchen veteran. He's seen it all and his motto is "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." Unfortunately, he doesn't quite see how broken things are. "More orders mean more work, simple as that!" he grumbles.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="character-intro">
                        <img src="images/characters/beau.png" alt="Beau, a friendly waiter looking stressed." class="character-profile">
                        <p><strong>Beau:</strong> Our frontline hero, the waiter. He's doing his best to juggle impatient customers. "Folks are waiting 45 minutes, sometimes an hour, just to get their food! My smile is wearing thin," he confides.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="character-intro">
                        <img src="images/characters/malik.png" alt="Malik, the head chef, looking thoughtful and concerned." class="character-profile">
                        <p><strong>Malik:</strong> The Head Chef and manager. He's a fair leader but is at his wit's end. The restaurant's reputation is on the line.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>The Boiling Point:</h3>
                    <p>One particularly chaotic Tuesday, Malik slammed his ladle down. "Enough! The wait times are unacceptable, ingredients are being wasted, the staff is burning out, and customer complaints are piling up like unwashed pots! Heidi, you were talking about 'Lean' principles and something called a 'Gemba Walk'. Explain it. Now."</p>
                    <p>Heidi stepped forward, "A Gemba Walk means we go to the 'gemba' – the actual place where work happens, our kitchen – and observe. We don't assume; we see. We identify every single step, every process, from when an order comes in to when it goes out. It's the first step to understanding our problems and finding solutions."</p>
                    <p>Malik nodded slowly. "Observation... I like the sound of that. <span id="storyPlayerNameAgain">Chef</span>, you'll assist Heidi. Let's see what this Gemba Walk reveals."</p>
